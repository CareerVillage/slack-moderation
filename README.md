# slack-moderation
A Django application that allows slack to be used as a "user generated content" moderation tool. This application was created by CareerVillage.org to use in its slack-based moderation system. The focus is on using moderators to identify inappropriate content so that it can be dealt with appropriately (typically, that means it gets deleted).
